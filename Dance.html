	<h1>David Dancing</h1>
	<p>I have as inspiration the Dominican “teteo” which are parties where the people dance. I wanted to make my character dance in this way to show this culture. I made this project an animation short and use a video of my brother dancing to create the animation. The technique I used was rotoscoping. In my storyboard, the concept was to animated lyrics in a solid background and change the scene to my character dancing in a solid background and repeat this sequence. I end it up doing an introduction with some animated shapes and text and then my character doing a peculiar dance.</p>
